00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.600
We're no strangers to love

2
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.700
You know the rules and so do I

3
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.700
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of

4
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.700
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

5
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.600
I just want to tell you how I'm feeling

6
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.100
Gotta make you understand

7
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.900
Never gonna give you up, never
gonna let you down

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.400
Never gonna run around and desert you

9
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.300
Never gonna make you cry,
never gonna say goodbye

10
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.400
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

11
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.400
We've known each other for so long

12
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.800
Your heart's been aching but
you're too shy to say it

13
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.900
Inside we both know what's been going on

14
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.100
We know the game and we're gonna play it

15
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.600
And if you ask me how I'm feeling

16
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.300
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

17
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.000
Never gonna give you up, never
gonna let you down

18
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.700
Never gonna run around and desert you

19
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.500
Never gonna make you cry,
never gonna say goodbye

20
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.800
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

21
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Never gonna give you up, never
gonna let you down

22
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.600
Never gonna run around and desert you

23
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.500
Never gonna make you cry,
never gonna say goodbye

24
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.500
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

25
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.500

We've known each other for so long

30
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.800
Your heart's been aching but
you're too shy to say it

31
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Inside we both know what's been going on

32
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.200
We know the game and we're gonna play it

33
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.600
I just want to tell you how I'm feeling
