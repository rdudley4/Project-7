2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.370
I've shown you how to use constructives,
prototypes and object laterals.

3
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.850
In this project we're going to
make use of all of these concepts.

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.760
We're going to create a quiz application.

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.490
The quiz will ask a series of questions,
and as we answer the questions,

6
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.020
the quiz will keep record of our score.

7
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.800
When the questions are all asked,
the application will display our score.

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.510
You're going to be tasked with creating
the JavaScript programming for

9
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.650
this application.

10
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.230
I've already got the HTML ready for you.

11
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.810
Let's take a quick look at
the application in the workspace

12
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.080
associated with this video.

13
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.440
Here we have an HTML file with
a H2 tag with the ID of question.

14
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.030
This is where we can put the question.

15
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.405
We have two choice paragraphs
with the IDs of choice zero and

16
00:00:55.405 --> 00:01:01.181
choice one And
we have two select answer buttons.

17
00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:06.720
With guess zero and guess one.

18
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.090
At the bottom here, we have
a paragraph with the ID of progress.

19
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.380
This is to indicate to the user
how far we are through the quiz.

20
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.100
I've created some JavaScript files to give
you hints on the direction you need to go.

21
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.370
You'll need the quiz itself,
which will keep track of the score and

22
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.910
the current question,
kind of like what the playlist was.

23
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.720
A playlist is a collection of songs.

24
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.780
A quiz is a collection of questions.

25
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.620
You'll also need something to
handle all the updates to the UI.

26
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.090
And finally, you need an app.js file to
start the application with all the objects

27
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.840
that you've created.

28
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.670
Look up the previous projects you
worked on to give you inspiration.

29
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.560
You can even copy and paste some of
the code to use as a starting point for

30
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.530
your objects.

31
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.780
It's not cheating.

32
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.160
In fact understanding existing code and
then applying that

33
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.270
code into another program is an important
skill for any JavaScript developer.

34
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.530
Remember the tools at your disposal.

35
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.150
You can use get element by ID
to get the HTML elements, but

36
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.010
you need to update with inner HTML.

37
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.500
You can assign methods to the onClick
of various elements like the buttons.

38
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.760
You've also got the ability to
use constructors, prototypes and

39
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.480
object literals.

40
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.980
Take some time to plot out the objects,
properties and methods you'll need.

41
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.380
In the following videos,
I'll show you my solution.

42
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.520
Give it a try and come back to me and
see how I did it.
