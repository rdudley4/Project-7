[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.284 --> 00:00:09.213
[SOUND] Text and images have always been
the foundation of web content, but

3
00:00:09.213 --> 00:00:13.761
more than ever, video and audio are also a
part of that content mix.

4
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:17.443
In this project, we'll learn how to use
the HTML video and

5
00:00:17.443 --> 00:00:20.280
audio elements to playback media.

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.980
We'll also learn how to add features like,
captioning and custom playback controls.

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.900
First, let's take a look at the project.

8
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.260
It's actually pretty simple.

9
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.390
It's just a video player on a web page
along with an audio player.

10
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.710
This may not look very impressive, but if
you've been working in web technology for

11
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.390
even just a few years, you probably know
how long it took for

12
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.280
web technology to catch up with video.

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.050
Video on the web used to involve plugins
like QuickTime, Flash, RealPlayer, and

14
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.400
several others.

15
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.280
However, using browser plug-ins is
typically bad for

16
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.830
accessibility, mobile devices, battery
life, and many other factors.

17
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.110
If you can avoid browser plugins, you
should, fortunately, we can create

18
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.750
standards based video and audio players
that don't require the use of plugins.

19
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.570
Adding video and

20
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.120
audio to a webpage is almost as easy as
adding an image or formatting some text.

21
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.080
In this course, we're going to spend most
of our time focusing on just two elements,

22
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.380
the video element and the audio element.

23
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.200
We'll learn about a few others, but those
two are the most important.

24
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.620
Now, let's move on and give the video
element a try.
