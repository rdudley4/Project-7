00:00:04.996 --> 00:00:07.860
[SOUND] Does writing plain JavaScript
scare you, or

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.933
do you simply want to get a better grasp
of JavaScript?

4
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.060
Then this is the course for you.

5
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.152
We're going to use JavaScript to create a
to-do list application without any

6
00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:19.710
third-party libraries like jQuery.

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.660
I'm Andrew, a JavaScript developer and

8
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.420
your guide to getting skilled up writing
pure JavaScript code.

9
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.860
JavaScript is becoming a general purpose
language, and it's used on

10
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.038
the server side with Node js, in
electronics with devices like the Tessel,

11
00:00:33.038 --> 00:00:37.705
and in crossplatform smartphone app SDKs
like Titanium.

12
00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:41.130
Browser based libraries, like jQuery, do a
lot of the heavy lifting for

13
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.870
common tasks in a cross browser compatible
way.

14
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.210
However, its ease of use can leave people
feeling

15
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.380
uncomfortable writing JavaScript alone.

16
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.760
We're going to do a handful of common
tasks that you could do easily with

17
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.940
jQuery but are just as nearly as easy to
write in pure JavaScript.

18
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.970
The aim of this course is to get you more
confident in your abilities writing

19
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.730
JavaScript code first in it's home in the
browser, so you can go out and

20
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.380
explore more possibilities.

21
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.900
If you're new to JavaScript,

22
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.060
you may want to checkout some of the other
JavaScript courses first.

23
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.770
They'll be linked in the teacher notes.
