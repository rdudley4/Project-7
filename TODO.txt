TODO LIST
---------

1. Re-do how spacing is handled within the transcript section.

     ※ Need to add a title for the transcript section, perhaps when doing this add a container div. Just apply a surrounding margin to this instead, and keep bottom margin on all transript elements on smaller screen sizes.


2. Maybe re-style how transcript 'blocks' look by default (mobile).

     ※ Perhaps reskin them to look similar to the transcript block on larger screen sizes, while still being separated. For example, instead of using square blocks and box shadow, give them rounded corners and a bottom border.

3. Add variables for repeating values, remove unused variables.

     ※ Need to add a functional variable for $white.
     ※ Need to add a descriptive & functional variable for #bbb (border-color).
     ※ May need to remove breakpoint variables as they are not being used.
        ※ As a result, may need to just remove mediaQuery mixin.
